Supported commands: 

    help    - Show this help page.
    
    config  - Basic settings. Use 'wlxt config show' to see your config.
              Takes arguments <key> <value>. You can also use 'wlxt config surnames'
              to set your personal surnames (maybe abbreviations) for your courses.

    kc      - List all courses with your surnames.

    zy      - List all homework. Takes arguments <course_name> <mode> [-f].
              List in format like 
                    未交: <course_name>: <hw_number> title <deadline> <grade>
              The course name can be its course id, its course name (both Chinese 
              or English), or your surname; supports regular expressions for surnames.
              You have to quote the regular expressions to avoid shell automatically 
              expanding wildcards like *.
              Mode can only be an integer from 0 to 7, whose binary digits represent
              showing homework that are *not handed in*, *not graded*, and *graded*
              correspondingly. Use [-f] option to refresh the cache by force.

    xzzy    - Download the attached file for given homework. 
              Takes arguments <course_name> <hw_number> <dir>. <course_name> is the 
              same logic as in the last paragraph. <hw_number> accepts - for downloading 
              all, so for example downloading any possible homework in the current 
              directory you can use the command 'wlxt xzzy ".*" - .' 

    ckzy    - View the homework instruction. Takes arguments <course_name> <hw_number>.
              You can only specify one homework at a time, which means you cannot pass
              .* to <course_name>. This operation changes continuous angle brackets into
              newlines in the html file (which should work most of the time).

    tjzy    - Hand in homework. Takes arguments <course_name> <hw_number>.
              You can only specify one homework at a time, which means you cannot pass
              .* to <course_name>. You cannot hand in a homework that is already graded.

    wj      - List all course files. Takes arguments <course_name> [-f].
              Use [-f] option to refresh the cache by force.

    xzwj    - Download course files. Takes arguments <course_name> <dir> [title].
              Here the title is the name listed in 'wlxt wj <course_name>'. If the 
              title argument is not specified, then it will download all *new* files. 
              The title argument also supports regular expressions.

    refresh - Deletes cache. Takes arguments 'courses', 'homework', 'files', or none.

For security reasons, the permission for any relevant file is set to rw-------.
